<p>India’s population is expected to grow by 25%, with reference to 2011, to 1.52 billion by 2036, according to the final report of the technical group on population projections dated July 2020. The group was constituted by the National Commission on Population (NCP) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with the mandate to provide population projections for the period 2011 to 2036.</p>



<p>India’s population growth rate is expected to decline to its lowest since the Independence in the 2011-2021 decade, with a decadal growth rate of 12.5%. It will decline further to 8.4% in the 2021-2031 decade, as per the report, which&nbsp;<em>The Wire</em>&nbsp;has seen.</p>

<p>The Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh industrial hub in Himachal Pradesh, surrounded by a panoramic view of the Shivalik hills, is home to Asia&#8217;s largest pharmaceutical manufacturing hub. It is serviced by a fleet of 13,000 trucks from small- and medium-sized transporters who have banded together to form the Nalagarh Truck Operators Union, Asia&#8217;s largest truck union.</p>



<p>In the past, whenever the union ran into friction with industry, it held its ground. For instance, in July 2020, when the union increased freight rates in response to a hike in diesel prices, the industry expressed displeasure but gave in to the union&#8217;s demand. On occasion, local politicians had to intervene between the union and industry to broker a resolution, for the union and its large membership carry political heft during elections, association members told us.</p>

<p><strong>Urbanization</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>urbanisation</strong>) refers to the population shift from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area">rural</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area">urban areas</a>, the corresponding decrease in the proportion of people living in rural areas, and the ways in which societies adapt to this change.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;It is predominantly the process by which&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town">towns</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City">cities</a>&nbsp;are formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in central areas.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>



<p>Although the 2 concepts are sometimes used interchangeably, urbanization should be distinguished from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl">urban growth</a>. Whereas urbanization refers to the&nbsp;<em>proportion</em>&nbsp;of the total national population living in areas classified as urban, urban growth strictly refers to the&nbsp;<em>absolute</em>&nbsp;number of people living in those areas.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;It is predicted that by 2050 about 64% of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_world">developing world</a>&nbsp;and 86% of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_world">developed world</a>&nbsp;will be urbanized.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;That is equivalent to approximately 3 billion urbanites by 2050, much of which will occur in Africa and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia">Asia</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization#cite_note-unfpa.org-5">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;Notably, the United Nations has also recently projected that nearly all global population growth from 2017 to 2030 will be by cities, with about 1.1 billion new urbanites over the next 10 years.</p>
